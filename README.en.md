## Why

Off-the-shelf NAS fan policies usually offer three presets — quiet / balanced / full —
and they only look at the **CPU** temperature.

But the CPU is rarely what suffers. WD recommends keeping hard drives below 50 °C, yet
on many machines the disks sit at 55 °C while the CPU idles, simply because the chassis
fan never considers them.

This app lets you **drive the chassis fan from disk temperature** while the CPU fan keeps
following the CPU — two independent curves. The design is inspired by
[FanControl](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases), deliberately reduced to the
essentials: **temperature sources + control curves + persisted configuration**.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🌡️ **Whole-machine coverage** | CPU (coretemp / k10temp / PECI), GPU (amdgpu / i915 / xe / nouveau / nvidia-smi), disks (drivetemp / nvme, `smartctl` fallback), plus motherboard (SYSTIN / CPUTIN / T_SENSOR), memory (jc42 / spd5118) and ACPI thermal zones — **each with its own switch** |
| 🔍 **Hardware wizard** | On first launch it lists **every** PWM channel the controller exposes, with live RPM and the temperature source the BIOS bound to it; a spin-up probe finds fans that were stopped |
| ⏬ **Calibration includes 0 %** | Calibration drives the fan down to 0 %, so it also reveals whether the fan supports stopping; the result is stored and shown again next time |
| 💽 **Disks selected by identity, not position** | Disks are identified by model + serial (`/dev/disk/by-id`) rather than `sda`/`sdb`, so re-cabling or changing the boot order keeps the selection on the same physical drive |
| 🖥️ **One source per GPU** | A single GPU is one "GPU" card; several GPUs become 显卡1 / 显卡2 … each with its own switch and its model shown inside — no more two checkboxes fighting over the same thing |
| 🎴 **GPUs identified by model** | GPUs are labelled with their PCI model (e.g. `Intel DG1 [Iris Xe Graphics]`) instead of a bare `i915`, and multiple cards can be selected individually |
| 👁️ **Disabled sources still report** | A switched-off source is still read and displayed, marked "not used for control" — so "this machine has no such sensor" never gets confused with "you have not enabled it" |
| 🎚️ **Two-point RPM calibration** | Hardware detection drives each header to 100 % and then to 0 %, reporting its **minimum/maximum RPM**, whether the PWM actually controls it, and whether the fan can be stopped (0 RPM at 0 %). The result is stored and shown again next time |
| 📍 **Operating point on the curve** | The live temperature and duty are plotted on the curve, so you can see exactly where the fan is being asked to run |
| 📈 **Visual curves** | One curve per fan, edited by dragging points in the browser, 2–8 points |
| 🎛️ **Modes** | Temperature curve / fixed duty / BIOS automatic, per fan |
| 🔀 **Max-of-many** | A fan can bind several sources and follows the hottest one |
| 🐢 **Hysteresis** | The fan only slows down after the temperature drops far enough, avoiding constant ramping |
| 💾 **Disk friendly** | Disks are polled on their own (longer) interval to avoid waking sleeping drives; the `smartctl` path uses `-n standby` and never spins a disk up |
| 🛡️ **Fail-safe** | If every source fails, the fan goes to a configurable safe duty and the UI warns you |
| ↩️ **Hands back safely** | Stopping or uninstalling returns the fans to the BIOS; removing a fan from the config restores that header to its pre-takeover state |
| 🪶 **Zero dependencies** | Backend is pure Python 3 standard library, frontend is plain JS with no build step — no nodejs / python312 runtime app required |

## Screenshots

> 📷 *TODO — contributions welcome.*

<!--
![Overview](docs/screenshots/overview.png)
![Curve editor](docs/screenshots/curve.png)
-->

The UI has three sections: **temperature sources** (CPU / GPU / disks, with per-disk
selection), **fans** (one card each: RPM, duty, driving temperature, mode, sources,
min/max duty and a draggable curve), and **global settings** (poll interval, disk poll
interval, hysteresis, fail-safe duty).

## Installation

### Requirements

- fnOS (`os_min_version ≥ 1.1.3100`, tested on `1.2.0604`)
- x86 board whose fans hang off a supported controller (see [Compatibility](#compatibility))
- An **administrator** account (installing third-party apps requires one)

### From a Release

1. Download `niufan-<version>.fpk` from [Releases](../../releases) (or use the copy in `dist/`)
2. fnOS **App Center → manual install**, pick the `.fpk`, choose a volume
3. Open **Fan Control**

Or from the shell:

```bash
sudo appcenter-cli install-fpk niufan-1.2.0.fpk -v 3   # -v is the volume index
sudo appcenter-cli start niufan
```

> ⚠️ `appcenter-cli install-fpk` does **not** upgrade an already-installed app of the same
> name — uninstall first (or use the App Center upgrade entry). Uninstalling keeps
> `config.json`, so your curves survive a reinstall.

## Usage

**The first launch requires a calibration run.** It is not a skippable intro: whether a given
header actually obeys PWM is exactly the thing that is hardest to work out afterwards — the UI
can look like it is controlling a fan while the fan ignores it, and the user is left thinking
the app is broken. Until you have run the probe and applied it, the wizard will not close and
the main interface is not reachable.

The probe spins each header up to full and back down to 0 % once, giving the RPM range for that
header and telling you whether it really responds to PWM and whether the fan can stop. **The one
exception**: a machine with no controllable PWM channel at all (fans managed by an EC, driver
missing, …) is not blocked — nothing can be set wrong there, so the wizard explains the
diagnosis instead.

Once you are in:

1. **Check the sources** — CPU / GPU / disks are the three main cards; motherboard, DIMM and ACPI
   zone readings live behind the “其它温度源” fold; per-disk temperatures and tick boxes are at the
   bottom. Untick the disks that should not take part
2. **Verify the header mapping** — the first install guesses from the BIOS configuration
   (headers watching a CPU core become CPU fans, the rest become chassis fans), but please
   **confirm which card is which physical header** by loading the CPU and watching which
   fan speeds up
3. **Tune the curve** — drag the dots, double-click empty space to add a point,
   right-click a dot to delete it
4. **Save** — applied immediately and written to disk

> 🔍 **硬件检测** (top bar, any time) shows the complete inventory: every temperature sensor
> including the ones with no reading — folded away with the reason (reads 0, out of plausible
> range for an unattached input, duplicate of the CPU source) — and every PWM header, with the
> silent ones folded as well.

> 💡 **Suggested starting point**: chassis fan → `disks`, CPU fan → `CPU`.
> A disk curve of `40 °C → 30 %`, `48 °C → 60 %`, `55 °C → 100 %` works well.

## Compatibility

Whether it works depends on **which controller the fans hang off, and whether its kernel
driver is supported here**. Each driver family uses **different `pwm_enable` values** —
writing the wrong one can hand fan control back to the BIOS or disable it altogether — so
every family has its own profile, taken from the kernel's `Documentation/hwmon/*.rst`:

| Controller family | Kernel driver | Manual | Auto | Status |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Nuvoton NCT6775 / 6776 / 6779 / 679x / 6106 | `nct6775` | `1` | `5` Smart Fan IV | ✅ tested |
| ITE IT87xx (IT8603E … IT87952E) | `it87` | `1` | `2` * | ✅ supported |
| Fintek F718xx / F8000 / F81865F | `f71882fg` | `1` | `2` | ✅ supported |
| Fintek F71805F / F71872F | `f71805f` | `1` | `2` | ✅ supported |
| Winbond W83627EHF / DHG / UHG / W83667HG | `w83627ehf` | `1` | `2` | ✅ supported |
| Winbond W83627HF / THF / W83697HF | `w83627hf` | `1` | `2` | ✅ supported |
| SMSC SCH5627 / SCH5636 | `sch5627` / `sch5636` | `1` | `2` | ✅ supported |
| **Nuvoton NCT6683 / 6686 / 6687** | `nct6683` | — | — | ⚠️ **monitor only** |
| Any other hwmon node exposing `pwmN` | any | `1` | `2` | ⚠️ generic fallback, unverified |
| ACPI `PNP0C0B` fan objects | — | — | — | ❌ DSDT stubs |
| Fans managed by an EC (laptops, some mini PCs) | — | — | — | ❌ no PWM node |

> Apart from the NCT6775 family, these profiles come from the kernel documentation and
> have **not been verified on real hardware**. If you own an ITE / Fintek / Winbond board,
> feedback is very welcome — see [Contributing](#contributing).

Development and test platform:

```
Board     ASUSTeK TUF B365M-PLUS GAMING (B365, LGA1151)
CPU       Intel CC150  8C/16T
Chip      Nuvoton NCT6796D @ 0x2e:0x290
Headers   6 PWM channels, 2 with a fan attached
System    fnOS 1.2.0604 / kernel 6.18.18.c1032-trim
```

### Two things worth knowing

**1. ITE automatic mode only works on old silicon.** The `it87` driver implements
"Smart Guardian" only for IT8705F ≤ rev F and IT8712F ≤ rev G; newer chips reject a `2`.
The app therefore falls back step by step: restore the recorded pre-takeover state →
try the driver's automatic mode → otherwise **go to full speed**. That last step matters:
without it, stopping the app on an ITE board that cannot select an automatic mode would
leave the fan stranded on the last duty it was given.

**2. ITE boards often need one extra step.** The `it87` driver may refuse to take over
because ACPI already claims the SuperIO I/O ports (`ACPI: resource conflict` in `dmesg`):

```bash
sudo modprobe it87 ignore_resource_conflict=1   # affects only this driver
# or add acpi_enforce_resources=lax to the kernel command line (broader)
```

**Why NCT6683 / 6686 / 6687 are monitor-only**: the kernel `nct6683` documentation states
that on Intel EC firmware the register layout does not match the Nuvoton datasheet, and
**writing any value from the OS is considered too risky and has been disabled** — the
driver simply does not expose a writable `pwmN`. Boards such as ASRock B650/X670E and
MSI B550/X670 are detected and reported honestly as monitor-only.

## Building from source

Requires the official `fnpack` tool, which ships with fnOS at `/usr/local/bin/fnpack`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiuFudi/niufan.git
cd niufan
./build-fpk.sh                     # produces dist/niufan-<version>.fpk
```

`build-fpk.sh` reads `appname`/`version` from `package/manifest`, cross-checks the `VERSION`
constant inside the daemon, runs `fnpack build`, renames the artifact to
`<appname>-<version>.fpk` in `dist/`, and verifies the version inside the finished package
matches its filename.

Icons can be regenerated with pure Python (no imaging library needed):

```bash
python3 tools/make_icons.py
```

## How it works

```
browser iframe
   └─ fnOS gateway /app/niufan     ← validates the session, forwards X-Trim-Isadmin
        └─ Unix socket  package/target/app.sock   ← no TCP port is ever opened
             └─ fancontrold.py (runs as root)
                  ├─ control loop: read temps → interpolate curve → write /sys/class/hwmon/*/pwmN
                  └─ HTTP thread: static UI + /api/*
```

Every `interval` seconds the control loop reads the enabled sources, takes the hottest
value among each fan's bound sources, interpolates the curve, clamps the result into
`min_duty`..`max_duty`, and writes `pwmN` **only when the value actually changes**. Speeding
down additionally requires passing the hysteresis check.

**Why root**: writing `/sys/class/hwmon/*/pwm*` (`0644 root:root`), `modprobe nct6775` and
reading SMART data all need it. That privilege belongs to the *application*, not the user —
install once and the daemon stays root; day-to-day tuning is web-only, no sudo, no shell.

## Configuration

Stored as JSON in the app config directory (`/volN/@appconf/niufan/config.json`) and
written atomically. Hand edits are normalised on the next save.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "enabled": true,          // master switch; false hands everything back to the BIOS
  "interval": 3,            // control period, seconds
  "hdd_interval": 60,       // disk poll interval, seconds (raise it to wake disks less)
  "hysteresis": 3,          // °C
  "fail_safe_duty": 255,    // duty used when every source fails
  "sources": {
    "cpu": true,
    "gpu": false,
    "hdd": true,
    "hdd_devices": []       // empty = hottest of all disks
  },
  "fans": [
    {
      "channel": 2,         // SuperIO channel
      "name": "CPU_FAN",
      "mode": "curve",      // curve | manual | auto
      "source": ["cpu"],    // several allowed, hottest wins
      "points": [[30, 20], [45, 35], [60, 60], [75, 100]],   // [°C, percent]
      "min_duty": 60,
      "max_duty": 255,
      "manual_duty": 128
    }
  ]
}
```

## HTTP API

A small JSON API over a Unix socket, authenticated and proxied by the fnOS gateway:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/ping` | liveness probe |
| GET | `/api/status` | sources, live fan state, current config |
| GET | `/api/config` | config only |
| GET | `/api/hardware` | detected SuperIO channels and disks |
| POST | `/api/config` | validate → persist atomically → apply |
| POST | `/api/action` | `{"action":"restore-auto"}` / `{"action":"refresh-hardware"}` |

The daemon also has standalone subcommands for troubleshooting (all need root):

```bash
python3 package/app/server/fancontrold.py status      --appdest <dir> --etc <dir>
python3 package/app/server/fancontrold.py init-config --appdest <dir> --etc <dir> [--force]
python3 package/app/server/fancontrold.py restore     --appdest <dir> --etc <dir>
python3 package/app/server/fancontrold.py run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8099   # local debug
```

## Safety design

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Stop / uninstall | Before exiting, the daemon writes `pwmN_enable=5` (BIOS auto) to the channels it **actually drove**; headers it never managed are left untouched |
| Daemon killed hard | `cmd/main` runs a blanket restore when it had to `kill -9` |
| Fan removed from config | That header is restored to its **recorded pre-takeover state** (enable + duty) |
| All sources fail | Fan goes to `fail_safe_duty` (full speed by default) and the UI warns |
| Non-administrator | The server checks the gateway's `X-Trim-Isadmin` header and returns `403` unless it is true (fail-closed) |
| Other local accounts | The app socket is `0600 root:root` — the gateway cannot be bypassed; access control stays with fnOS login |
| Path traversal | Static file serving validates the resolved path stays inside the UI directory |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>The UI says no fan controller was found</b></summary>

Check that the driver loaded:

```bash
sudo modprobe nct6775
dmesg | grep -iE "nct|it87|f718|w836|sch56"   # was the chip recognised?
cat /sys/class/hwmon/*/name                    # which nodes did drivers register?
ls /sys/class/hwmon/*/name | xargs cat | grep -i nct
```

If `dmesg` shows `ACPI: resource conflict`, ACPI has claimed the SuperIO I/O ports and you
need `acpi_enforce_resources=lax` on the kernel command line, then reboot.

If the UI names a chip such as `it87`, that model simply is not supported yet — see
[Compatibility](#compatibility).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The app shows Bad Gateway (502)</b></summary>

The gateway cannot reach the app — it is either not running or its socket is missing:

```bash
sudo appcenter-cli status niufan
ls -la /var/apps/niufan/target/app.sock    # the decisive check
sudo /var/apps/niufan/cmd/main status; echo "exit=$?"
```

If the status says running but the socket is gone, that is the defect fixed in 1.7.1: the PID
file survives a reboot and the kernel re-uses PIDs, so after a reboot an unrelated service can
inherit the old PID and a bare `kill -0` makes the app look alive, which stops the app center
from starting it. Recover with:

```bash
sudo appcenter-cli stop niufan
sudo rm -f /var/apps/niufan/var/app.pid
sudo appcenter-cli start niufan
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>RPM reads fine but changing PWM does nothing</b></summary>

Run **Hardware detection → Active probe**: it measures each header at ~30 % and 100 % duty
and, when a header reports a fan but ignores the duty cycle, it lists the reason directly.

| Finding | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Wrote duty X but read back Y | The register rejected the write; the driver or chip ignored it |
| Writing `pwmN_enable` was refused | The chip never entered manual mode, so the BIOS curve is still in charge |
| Mode shows **DC** | DC voltage control; some boards ignore duty writes in this mode. Try `echo 1 > .../pwmN_mode` and re-test |
| Registers read back correctly but RPM never moves | The fan or the wiring: a 3-pin fan on a PWM header ignores the 4th wire and runs at a constant speed |

Minimal manual check (`hwmonX` = the real node):

```bash
H=/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonX
cat $H/pwm1_mode; cat $H/pwm1_enable
echo 1 > $H/pwm1_enable
echo 255 > $H/pwm1; sleep 5; cat $H/fan1_input
echo 76  > $H/pwm1; sleep 5; cat $H/fan1_input
```

Same RPM both times means the write never reaches the fan; different means control works and
the problem is the curve or the configuration.

> Give the fan time to settle: a large chassis fan can take several seconds to slow down, and
> reading too early returns the *previous* speed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b><code>pwmN_enable</code> does not read back what was written</b></summary>

A known driver quirk. On NCT6796D, writing `1` (manual) reads back as `0`. The app therefore
does **not** rely on the readback: it tracks the mode it applied itself, and the UI shows the
app's effective mode.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A 4-pin fan reports 0 RPM</b></summary>

Either no fan is plugged into that header, or the fan has no tachometer wire. The default
configuration only includes headers that report a tach signal; if a fan was stopped at scan
time and got missed, add it back with the "add this channel" control and use the card's
"remove" button if you change your mind.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I worry about waking my disks</b></summary>

Raise **Global settings → disk temperature interval** (e.g. 300 s). Disks that expose a
`drivetemp` / `nvme` hwmon node are read through plain sysfs; only disks without one fall back
to `smartctl -n standby`, which by design does not wake a sleeping drive.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome, especially:

- **Hardware coverage** — if you have an ITE / Fintek / other SuperIO board, please share
  `dmesg`, `ls /sys/class/hwmon/*/name` and `sensors` output so support can be evaluated
- **Screenshots** — they would make this README much more complete
- **English proofreading** — this file

## Disclaimer

This software writes directly to the SuperIO PWM registers. The author designed it to fail
safely (fail-safe duty, handing fans back on stop, minimum duty limits), but **accepts no
liability for hardware damage or data loss** arising from its use. Evaluate the risk
yourself, especially on a board that has not been verified.
